## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
2. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
3. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
   1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/sakura.sakura.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run sakura.sakura.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:
      ```
      Hello from
   
             ######   #                   ##########           #       
                      #   ###    ######            # ######### #   ### 
           ########## ####            #           #  #       # ####    
                #     #               #   ########   #       # #       
                #     #               #       ##     #       # #       
               #      #        ##########   ##       ######### #       
             ##        #######            ##                    #######
